# Geographical Plotting with Plotly
This repository contains a collection of interactive choropleth maps that visualize various global and US datasets using the Plotly library in Python. The maps are designed to provide an easy-to-understand and engaging way to explore the data and gain insights into geographical trends and patterns.

# Datasets
The following datasets have been used in this project:

1. 2014 Global GDP
2. Global Power Consumption 2014
3. US Agriculture Exports 2014
4. Voting Age Population 2012

# Interactive Choropleth Maps
Each dataset is visualized as a choropleth map that colors the countries or US states based on the values in the dataset. The maps are interactive and allow users to zoom in and out, hover over individual regions to see detailed information, and select different color scales and legends to gain a deeper understanding of the data.

# Technical Details
The maps were created using the Plotly Python library, which provides a simple and powerful way to create interactive visualizations. The data was cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy libraries. The project is structured as a Jupyter notebook and the code is fully documented for easy modification and reuse.

# How to Use
To view the maps and explore the data, simply open the Jupyter notebook in your browser or run it locally on your machine. The notebook contains detailed instructions on how to interact with the maps and change the color scales and legends to suit your needs.
